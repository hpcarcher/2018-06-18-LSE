  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these

        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

  <h3>Make</h3>

  <p>
    Originally invented to manage compilation of programs written in
      languages like C, Make can be used to automatically update any set
      of files that depend on another set of files. This makes it a good
      solution for many data analysis and data management
      problems. While there are many build tools now in existence
      (e.g. ANT and CMake) they share the same fundamental concepts as
      Make. 
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">

      <h4 id="r-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
          <p>
    For OS X, version 10.9 (Mavericks) or above, download the Command Line
    Tools by doing:    
    </p>
    <pre>xcode-select  --install</pre>
    <p>
    For more information, see the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">OSX Daily blog</a>.
    </p>
    If you have an older OS X version and you do not already have 
    access to <code>make</code> from within
    your shell, you will need to install XCode (which is free, but
    over a gigabyte to download). 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Apple app store</li>
      <li>Search for XCode</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Free</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>Install App</strong></li>
    </ul>

    </p>

      <li>Click <strong>Applications</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>XCode</strong></li>
      <li>Select <strong>XCode&rarr;Preferences...</strong></li>
